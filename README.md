This is a minimal [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project intended to serve as an example of how to build your own custom minting pages for Scatter collections by utilizing our public API. We used Next.js for the example because we like it, but you can integrate the Scatter API with anything that is capable of sending web requests.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
